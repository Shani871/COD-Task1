# Description
The Java Simple Calculator with Advanced Features is a program designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. The calculator provides a user-friendly interface and includes the option to quit the program.

Features:

Basic Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers.
Exponentiation: The calculator allows users to calculate the exponentiation of a base number raised to a power.
User Interface: The program provides a simple command-line interface for user interaction.
Option to Quit: Users have the option to quit the program when they are done using the calculator.
How the Program Works:

The Java Simple Calculator program consists of three main classes: Calculator, CalculatorOperations, and CalculatorUtils.

Calculator.java: This class serves as the main class of the program. It handles user interaction, including displaying the menu of operations, taking user input, and calling methods from the CalculatorOperations class to perform calculations.
CalculatorOperations.java: This class contains methods to perform different arithmetic operations. It includes methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
CalculatorUtils.java: This utility class includes helper methods for input validation and displaying messages to the user.
When the program starts, the Calculator class displays a menu of operations to the user. The user selects an operation by entering a corresponding number. The program then prompts the user to enter the required numbers for the selected operation.

Once the user provides the input, the program calls the appropriate method from the CalculatorOperations class to perform the calculation. The result is then displayed to the user.

The program continues to prompt the user for input until the user chooses to quit by selecting the corresponding option from the menu.
